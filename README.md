# 100 Days of Code - Python  
Welcome to my '100 Days of Code - Python' journey!  

This repository is a collection of projects I completed during the 'Master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days' course by Dr. Angela Yu on Udemy. The course is an exciting dive into Python development, covering diverse topics such as:  
- Data Science  
- Automation  
- Web Development  
- Game and App Development  

#About the Journey  
Over 100 days, I worked on building one project daily, strengthening my skills in Python programming while exploring various domains. Each project is a stepping stone, designed to solidify concepts, solve problems, and inspire innovation.  

# Repository Structure  
The repository is organized by days, with each folder containing:  
- The project source code.  
- A brief description of the project's purpose and functionality.  
- Any additional resources or files needed for execution.  

#Example:  
```  
Day 01
Day 02 
Day 03
...  
```  

# Key Takeaways  
1. Improved Python programming skills through hands-on practice.  
2. Gained experience in diverse areas, including automation, web scraping, and game development.  
3. Built a strong portfolio of projects to showcase my capabilities.
